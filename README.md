### üîç Sidebar Navigation ###
The sidebar is a fixed, vertical navigation element positioned on the left side of the screen. <br>

* It serves as a visual anchor and provides easy access to important sections or features of the website/application. <br>
* The sidebar items, represented by icons and optional text labels, change color to a light gray shade when hovered over.

* This tooltip is a crucial element that provides additional context and details about the channel. <br>
* It includes the channel's name, displayed in a prominent font size and weight, along with the number of subscribers, providing an indication of the channel's popularity and reach.
* Furthermore, the tooltip features the channel's logo or profile picture, adding a visual representation that enhances recognition and brand awareness.

<details>

### üéØ Tooltip Appearance ###
Tooltips on the buttons play a crucial role in enhancing user experience and providing contextual information about the functionality of each button. 
* When a user hovers over a button, a small tooltip appears, offering a brief text description that explains the purpose or action associated with that button.
* This behavior is particularly important for buttons that may not be immediately self-explanatory, such as the "YouTube Apps" or "Create" buttons.

<details>
<summary><i>What is the importance of it?</i></summary>

>The tooltips are designed to be non-intrusive yet informative. <br>
>They appear as a small box with a slightly transparent background and white text, ensuring readability while not obscuring the main content. <br>
>The tooltips are positioned strategically below the buttons, providing a clear connection between the button and its description.
